              The Sales team at Bob Rohrman Kia had no shortage of opportunities
              Leads were coming in from multiple channels at all times of the
              day and night, with more than 45% originating during off-hours.

              With rapidly growing lead volume, the sales team was stretched to
              its limit. Responding to every inbound inquiry while trying to
              nurture customer relationships was becoming increasingly
              difficult, Too much time was being spent answering basic questions
              and chasing unresponsive leads, preventing sales reps from
              focusing on closing deals.
